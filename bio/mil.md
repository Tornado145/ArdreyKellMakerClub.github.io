Hi!

I'm Michael Lee, and I make coding for the computer thingys that sometimes work and other times just make things crash and burn.

I'm also in charge of the Software section, and this website which I totally won't do anything with...

If you have any questions, would like to post anything important, or just want to completely ruin Daniel's page, let me know.

@Emeraldz54 is me. Yea. That's me.
